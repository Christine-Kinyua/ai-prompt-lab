# AI Prompt Engineering Lab

Welcome to my **AI Prompt Engineering Lab**, a collection of prompt design experiments, evaluations, and insights based on my exploration of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. This project reflects my growing interest in AI alignment, human-AI interaction, and natural language task design.

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm Christine Nkuene Kinyua, currently pursuing an MSc in Financial Engineering with a background in Mathematics and Operations Research. I bring a structured, analytical approach to understanding how AI systems interpret and respond to human input.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Explore how LLMs process different prompt formats and instruction types
- Document patterns in AI behavior across reasoning, classification, and decision tasks
- Simulate the kinds of tasks performed in AI training and data labeling roles
- Develop intuition for prompt clarity, structure, and failure cases

## 🔍 Prompt Categories Explored

- **Sentiment Classification** – Testing LLM reliability on subjective inputs  
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** – Breaking down logic-based questions  
- **Bias Evaluation** – Subtle prompts to assess model neutrality  
- **Instruction Following** – Precision and verbosity control  
- **Ambiguity Detection** – Testing LLM understanding of vague queries

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- ChatGPT (GPT-4 / GPT-3.5)
- Python (for automation and formatting)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Markdown documentation

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Prompt engineering is at the heart of how humans interact with modern AI. As someone interested in AI training, finance, and optimization, understanding the logic and failure modes of language models is critical. This lab is my contribution toward building smarter, safer, and more interpretable AI systems.
